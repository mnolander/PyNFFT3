# PyNFFT3

Python Interface for the [NFFT C library](https://github.com/NFFT/nfft) 

`PyNFFT3` provides the following fast algorithms and includes test scripts for each:
- nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT) 
- nonequispaced fast cosine transform (NFCT) 
- nonequispaced fast sine transform (NFST)
- fast summation (fastsum) 

## Getting started

In Julia you can get started by just typing

```julia
] add NFFT3
```

then checkout the [documentation](https://nfft.github.io/NFFT3.jl/stable/).
